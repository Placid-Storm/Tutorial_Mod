# Tutorial_Mod

This mod was produced with the help of a tutorial by Loremaster. I focussed this mod something I thought was missing from Minecraft. Mage weapons and armor. All items presented are based on re-textures of original Minecraft Textures. I claim no rights to those textures or their use.

See the Wiki for the recipes contained in this mod.

I am including this link so you can watch the Tutorial and produce your own mod. Loremaster does a decent job explaining the steps he takes in making the tutorial.
